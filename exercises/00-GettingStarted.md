## Launching the development environment

> ðŸ’¡ Prerequisite: Do ensure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your local machine!

Let's get things up and running!

Firstly, clone this repository and navigate into the main codebase

```console
git clone https://github.com/GovTechSG/2021-bootcamp-gds.git
git fetch
cd 2021-bootcamp-gds
```

Checkout to the exercise branch

```console
git checkout exercises/frontend
```

Run the command below:

```console
docker-compose up --build
```

If running docker compose in detached mode instead (`docker-compose up --build --detach`), viewing the logs of a container is simple:

```console
docker logs 2021-bootcamp-gds_frontend_1
```

```console
docker logs 2021-bootcamp-gds_backend_1
```

To tear down the environment:

```console
docker-compose down
```

If all is good, access the locally hosted front end app at `http://localhost:3000/`
