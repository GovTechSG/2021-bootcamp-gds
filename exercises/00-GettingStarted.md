## Launching the development environment

> ðŸ’¡ Prerequisite: Do ensure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your local machine! Also, make sure that Docker desktop is running on the background!

Let's get things up and running!

Firstly, clone this repository and navigate into the main codebase

```console
git clone <your-repo-here>
git fetch
cd 2021-bootcamp-gds
```

Checkout to the exercise branch

```console
git checkout exercises/frontend
```

Run the command below:

```console
docker-compose up --build
```

If running docker compose in detached mode instead (`docker-compose up --build --detach`), viewing the logs of a container is simple:

```console
docker logs 2021-bootcamp-gds_frontend_1
```

```console
docker logs 2021-bootcamp-gds_backend_1
```

To tear down the environment:

```console
docker-compose down
```

If all is good, access the locally hosted front end app at `http://localhost:3000/`
