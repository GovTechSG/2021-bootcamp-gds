## Launching the development environment
Let's get things up and running!

```console
docker-compose up --build
```

If running docker compose in detached mode instead (`docker-compose up --build --detach`), viewing the logs of a container is simple:

```console
docker logs 2021-bootcamp-gds_frontend_1
```

```console
docker logs 2021-bootcamp-gds_backend_1
```

To tear down the environment:

```console
docker-compose down
```
