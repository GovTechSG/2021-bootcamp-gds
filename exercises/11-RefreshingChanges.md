In this exercise, we will add a refresh button to the Todo application.

## Adding a button

Let's start by adding a button.
```tsx
<Button type="button" isOutline>
  <span className='sgds-icon sgds-icon-refresh' />
</Button>
```

The button can be placed anywhere, we've decided to put it just above the table and to the right of the 'Submit' button.
```tsx
<Row>
  <Col is={10}>
    <input className="input" id='newTodoDescription' type='text' value={newTodoDescription}
      onChange={(event) => { setNewTodoDescription(event.currentTarget.value) }} />
  </Col>
  <Col>
    <Button isPrimary isLoading={false}>Submit</Button>
  </Col>
  <Col>
    {/* insert button here */}
  </Col>
</Row>
```

These Buttons are standard SGDS components and come in different styles! Check them out [here](https://govtechsg.github.io/sgds-govtech-react/?path=/story/components--buttons).

## Making it click

When a button is `clicked`, it fires the attached `onClick(event)` handler.
Start by defining a new callback:

```tsx
const onRefreshClicked = useCallback(async () => {
  console.log('Refresh button clicked');
}, []);
```

Then hook it up to the button:
```tsx
<Button type="button" isOutline onClick={/* insert callback function here */}>
  <span className='sgds-icon sgds-icon-refresh' />
</Button>
```

When refresh is clicked, you should now see a log entry appear in the console!

Instead of calling `console.log()`, let's make it call `populateTodos`:
```tsx
const onRefreshClicked = useCallback(async () => {
  console.log('Refresh button clicked');
  await /* insert asynchronous network-bound function call here */
  console.log('todoList updated');
}, [populateTodos]);
```

An *asynchronous* function `populateTodos()` is making a network call to our backend API to get the latest `todoList`. The `await` keyword means that these statements will block, happening *sequentially* one after another. That means that the second log entry is created only after the refresh is complete.

The dependencies array `[populateTodos]` tells React to watch out for changes in `populateTodos`. It's easy to get used to, and you'll see more of it later.

## Making Progress

Visual feedback is an important way of communicating with the user.

A progress indicator satisfies the user's need to know that the system received, and is processing, their request.

Start by adding a new piece of state to the Todo component:
```tsx
const [isRefresh, setIsRefresh] = useState(false);
```

Creating state in this way is useful because React can 'hook' into every modification to the state and help keep track of what changed / needs to be rendered again.

When calling the `useState()` hook, React gives you a read-only variable (with the default parameter specified in the `useState<T>(default: T)` call), and a setter you can call like this: `setIsRefresh(true)`.

Let's hook up the `isRefresh` state to the button's progress indicator.
```tsx
<Button type="button" isOutline isLoading={/* insert boolean refresh state here */} onClick={onRefreshClicked}>
  <span className='sgds-icon sgds-icon-refresh' />
</Button>
```

When the button is clicked, it should set the loading indicator with `setIsRefresh(true)`.
```tsx
const [isRefresh, setIsRefresh] = useState(false);
const onRefreshClicked = useCallback( async () => {
  /* start the refresh here */
  setTimeout(async () => {
    await populateTodos();
    /* stop the refresh here */
  }, 400);
}, [populateTodos]);
```

The refresh animation starts before starting the actual refresh operation. When the `await populateTodos()` synchronously completes, the refresh animation stops.

On a local network, this refresh happens too quickly to be perceptible, so we're waiting a couple hundred milliseconds to ~~charge our capacitors~~ queue up the request.
